excerpt:  In this essay, Mireya Vargas casts a restful look upon her
          work experiences in the field of social investment with numerous
          Venezuelan communities, under the light of C.G. Jung’s
          complexes theory. And this she does in a novel way, presenting
          us with the realities of a diversity of human collectives through
          the stories of individuals and family groups in which we can all
          recognise ourselves.
