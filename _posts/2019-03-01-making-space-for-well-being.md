excerpt: My story with well-being began with my divorce, ten years after getting married. At that moment, my professional life was more important than my personal life. This breaking point in my life when I was 37 years old thaught me a hard lesson about failure, and showed me how important is it to look for a balance between different aspects of your personal life.

					<p>My story with well-being began with my divorce, ten years after getting married. At that moment, my professional life was more important than my personal life. This breaking point in my life when I was 37 years old thaught me a hard lesson about failure, and showed me how important is it to look for a balance between different aspects of your personal life.</p>
					<p>Soon after I got divorced, a deadly landslide took place in my home country, Venezuela.  Overwhelmed with all the deaths and the destruction that resulted from the natural disaster, it was forced to think about new ways to work in human reconstruction processes.  It was as if my midlife or my psyche demanded a change in my way of understanding reality, my work, and the way to live my life.</p>
					<p>From that moment on, I began to work my own psychotherapy with a Jungian analyst, Dr. López Pedraza, and rapidly, all my life began to change because began to work with my shadows and different unconscious complexities of my life. I got married again, to Pablo, and began to approach to Psychology as a subject, under supervision.  My work changed a lot too. I began to work focussing on personal changes of people in the community, and to work with human development and capability building approach. Moreover, I understood that if you are unable to change your personal life, it is impossible to change the life of the community, because the change is personal and psychological.</p>
					<p>Another process of the landslide that ocurred in our society in 1999: a political revolutionary process that after years of its establishment has brought an economic, social and political phenomenon that affects us all. We are constantly exposed to many social tensions and destruction; violence, shortages and changes in how social relationships take place that demand from us the development of a new process of reconstruction in Venezuela.  A new palette of emotions has emerged among the Venezuelan people and in myself: anger, envy, sense of fairness, shame, indignation, hate, pain, jealousy, grief, condolences, resentment, sadness or suffering.  I have to learned how to live without knowing anything about what the future will be and learning to live only the present. I have had to learn to manage shortages, to have a greater awareness of the use of money or resources, appreciate new aspects of solidarity, joy, love, gratitude or satisfaction with life and manage my differences and be tolerant with others. </p>
					<p>It is a new challenge to my psyche and my life as a whole, because we have many ways of becoming impoverished. So, for me the challenge of staying outside the country and living this process of personal and social change at a distance, is to learn more about different ways of life and living it. For these reasons I continue with my psychology studies, working with social agents of change in areas of well-being and researching to evaluate impacts on these areas of life.</p>
					<p>In 2015, together with the University of Oxford, we explored absent psychological dimensions in the measurement of poverty. This study in Venezuela taught us how people's lives are affected and impoverished by shame and humiliation, isolation and social loneliness, social disconnection from others, anxiety and fear, violence and personal insecurity, lack of participation in decision making. Therefore we need to go beyond material well-being and work on psychological dimensions.</p>
					<p>Since 2017, I have been participating in The Well-being Project, promoted by Aaron Pereira, an Ashoka Fellow, who had the same approach to work as we had years ago in Vargas and later, with Ashoka fellows. Social entrepreneurs from all over the world have worked in this project for 2 years and we have learnt together that personal well-being passes, of necessity, through the connection with one's own emotional life, with the "here and now" and with greater awareness of oneself. Also I initiated meditation practices, yoga, personal care routines in diet and exercise. This has allowed me to learn how to pay attention to caring for my body and soul, as a unit that makes up my psyche. Keeping these small routines with modest goals, plus the work of full awareness, and my psychotherapy, have allowed me to overcome this difficulty of doing it as a daily job. It is a continuous struggle, because it is not easy to be aware of this higher need for connection with oneself all the time.</p>
					<p>Working on our psychic life has driven me to think how to go further to make this process more vivid and lasting in time, and how to speed up the possibilities of making this initiative grow for new agents of change. With this approach we can work in Latin America, attending the personal well-being environment of such agents of change, and creating tools which make it easier to reach higher levels of awareness or consciousness and full attention for oneself.</p>
					<p>This involves working on the development of capacities of the same social entrepreneurs in complete cycles of 18 months. But we also want to do it virtually, such as designing toolkits and indicating paths to follow, from different methodologies, towards a deeper work on one's own personal well-being. We propose promoting research, and widening the base of knowledge on this topic, and finally, widely promulgating these well-being visions and practices, so that they are part of public policies and development goals.</p>
					<p>López Pedraza, my master and psychotherapist said “Our survival requires that we live our life as if it were a constant psychotherapy, to let our psyche have priority, to allow it to differentiate between what is psychic and appeals to its unique nature, and what is not psychic, and to allow it to live the feelings and emotions that nourish it. This is the most immediate way to connect to our nature, instincts, and history, and to the life we live. In other words, psychotherapy in this sense is an attempt to make life as psychic as we can, to keep our psyche in movement. If we fail we must suffer the consequences of a psychic disturbance, an illness, or the most common consequence of a repetitive and stagnant life.”</p>
					<p>This statement leads me to questions that provoke our group discussion, thinking how to increase the possibility of helping one's own psychological life and well-being and that of others:</p>
					<ul>
						<i>What is personal well-being for social agents of change like you? What does it mean to have a personal well-being?</i>
						<i>How can we make space for it? What micro-actions can we do to work on our personal well-being?</i>
						<i>What tools and capacities do we need to work on to reach this encounter between the psychic life and oneself and with others?</i>
						<i>How can we accelerate the possibilities of spreading this personal well-being to many others?</i>
